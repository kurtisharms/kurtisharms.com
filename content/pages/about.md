# Hi, my name is Kurtis...

**I'm a trained mechanical engineer and future lawyer who is proud to call Vancouver, B.C., Canada home.** I love travelling and have had the opportunity to visit every Canadian province, the USA, England, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg, Switzerland, France, Spain, Czech Republic, Croatia, Italy, Cuba, Mexico... and counting. But every time I return home to Vancouver I am reminded how fortunate I am to call this outdoor city home.

I enjoy keeping busy pursuing a diversified range of personal and professional interests and skills: whether that is programming in a variety of different languages, adjusting the rigging on a sailboat, playing the piano, or taking on a leadership role in organizing and promoting an event. Today's challenges are never limited in scope to one subject or one area of expertise, and my lifelong goal is to continually work towards a better understanding and appreciation in being able to operate in today's multi-faceted environment, linking ideas and skill sets.

**I began computer programming at the age of 11, literally out of my family garage.** I still remember that moment quite vividly, sitting on the cold garage floor hoping that my computer would boot! It was an old Pentium I computer that I had re-built out of two broken computers discarded in a recycling bin. I discovered Linux, fell in love with the open source movement, and released my very own open source project which was featured on sourceforge.net and softpedia.com when I was 14 years old. I still remember how I elated I was when it had over 2,000 downloads in the first year of availability. I have since worked several computer software jobs.

**My more recent accomplishments include being Team Co-Captain of UBC Sailbot, an engineering student team which builds autonomous sailboats.** Sailing is a hobby that I have pursued since I was a kid, and when I heard that some crazy engineers were trying to build autonomous sailboats, I knew I had to be part of this incredible team that is based out of the University of British Columbia. In summer 2016 I was proud to be leading the team in our endeavour to set a world record for autonomous sail travel across the Atlantic Ocean.
