# Hi, my name is Kurtis...

**I'm a future Lawyer and Mechanical Engineer making the very most out of life in Vancouver, British Columbia!** They often call Vancouver the most livable city on earth, but with school and many involvements, I don't have nearly as much time as I would like to enjoy it. I also think it's intrinsic to my personality that I must remain busy, though!

I strive to be a diversified individual, both in my personal and professional life: I am equally experienced in programming in 4 different languages, adjusting the rigging on a sailboat, playing Mozart on the piano, or taking on a leadership role in organizing and promoting an event. Today's challenges are never limited in scope to one subject or one area of expertise, and my lifelong goal is to continually work towards a better understanding and appreciation in being able to operate in today's multi-faceted environment, linking ideas and skill-sets.



**I began computer programming at the age of 11, literally out of my garage!** I still remember that moment quite vividly, sitting on the cold garage floor hoping that my computer would boot! It was an old Pentium I computer that I had re-built out of two broken computers discarded in a recycling bin. I discovered Linux, fell in love with the open source movement, and released my very own open source project which was featured on sourceforge.net and softpedia.com when I was 14 years old. I still remember how I elated I was when it had over 2,000 downloads in the first year of availability. I have since worked several computer software jobs, and still do contract jobs on the side, when time permits.


My more recent accomplishments include being Team Co-Captain of UBC Sailbot, an engineering student team which builds autonomous sailboats. Sailing is a hobby that I have pursued since I was a kid, and when I heard that some crazy engineers were trying to build autonomous sailboats, I knew I had to be part of this incredible team that is based out of UBC. In summer 2016, I was proud to be leading the team in our endeavour to set a world record for autonomous sail travel across the Atlantic Ocean. You can read more about UBC Sailbot's incredible journey at http://ubcsailbot.org/blog/.

You can also find me often cycling around Vancouver. I really took up cycling as a way to get to work and also bike around Vancouver's Stanley Park in the evenings in summer 2014, and I have been hooked ever since!

Follow my new blog on this website for tech and personal ramblings. I'll also be posting my personal projects, with more to come in the imminent future!
